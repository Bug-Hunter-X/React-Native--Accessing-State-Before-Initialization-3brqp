# React Native: Accessing State Before Initialization

This repository demonstrates a common error in React Native: accessing a state variable before it has been initialized.  The `Bug.js` file shows the problematic code, while `BugSolution.js` provides a corrected implementation.

**Problem:** Attempting to access state in the render method before the component has mounted leads to unexpected behavior or crashes. This often occurs when asynchronous operations update the state, but the render method tries to access it before the update is complete.

**Solution:**  Ensure state is accessed only after it's been initialized, typically within `componentDidMount()` or after an async operation resolves. Consider using conditional rendering or placeholder UI elements to handle cases where the state is still initializing.
